Navigate the whole app and perform all actions using only their keyboard
View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
Bonus: Save details to a database (build the project as a full-stack app)
Bonus: Create an account, log in, change password (add user authentication to the full-stack app)
